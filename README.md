# üíª SymbNET üß¨ From Metagenomics to Metabolic Interactions (Day 5) 

### üí∞ Learning Outcomes

This module will cover practical aspects of metagenomics-based metabolic modeling:

 - Generating genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs)
 - Predicting metabolic interactions within communities of GEMs
 - Exploring the effect of gapfilling and simulation media

### üí° Key points: CarveMe

1. The top-down approach
   - based on a universal and well-curated bacterial model, **carves** out a species specific model based on organism's genome.
2. The BiGG database
   - connects protein sequences with standardized and curated metabolic reaction knowledgebase.
3. The carving algorithm
   - MILP formulation to maximize presence of high genomic evidence reactions, minimize presence of low genomic evidence reactions, enforce gapless pathways.
4. The gap-filling algorithm
   - Uses genomic evidence scores to prioritize and minimize the number of added reactions needed to support growth on a given a media composition.

Note: model carving and gapfilling problems can result in multiple possible solutions!

### üîë Key points: SMETANA

1. The species coupling score measures the dependence of growth of species A on species B (SCS<sub>A,B</sub>)
   - calculated by enumerating all possible community member subsets where species A can grow, SCS<sub>A,B</sub> is the fraction of subsets where both species A and B can grow

2. The metabolite uptake score measures the dependence of growth of species A on metabolite *m* (MUS<sub>A,*m*</sub>)
   - calculated by enumerating all possible metabolite requirement subsets where species A can grow, MUS<sub>A,*m*</sub> is the fraction of subsets where both species A grows and metabolite *m* is taken up


2. The SMETANA score ranges from 0 to 1
   - measures how strongly a receiver species relies on a donor species for a particular metabolite

### üç± Tentative structure

- Carve your own MAGs
  - Dump MAGs into folder, run Snakefile rule to carve in series or in parallel
  - Run model_vis.R script to visualize rxns,speices,number genes
  - Classify GEMs/MAGs using metaGEM-gtdbtk (if not done previously)
- Run most basic SMETANA example with 2 species
  - Could have them use metaGEM parser for this and previous step
  - Run smetana_vis.R script to visualize interactions in one medium
  - Change media composition with basic 2 species example
  - Run smetana_vis.R to visualize differences in interactions across 2 different media
- Choose your own adventure, explore either:
  - Interactions across 10 different media for 2 species
  - Interactions across 2 different media for 5 species
- Real world test case: metaGEM gut dataset
  - Go through dataset and analysis, showing how different mets/donors/receivers were identified across conditions
  - Simulate interactions between X species across all samples where species are present, identify statistically significant differences, visualize results
- Discussion on different analysis options/avenues
  - Other applications?
