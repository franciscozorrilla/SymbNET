## From Metagenomics to Metabolic Interactions (Day 5)

### Learning Outcomes

This module will cover practical aspects of metagenomics-based metabolic modeling, including:

 - Generating genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) 
 - Predicting metabolic interactions within communities of GEMs
 - Understanding the effect of gapfilling and simulation media
 - Exploring the panmetabolism of genomes

### Tentative structure

- Carve your own MAGs
  - Dump MAGs into folder, run Snakefile rule to carve in series or in parallel
  - Run model_vis.R script to visualize rxns,speices,number genes
  - Classify GEMs/MAGs using metaGEM-gtdbtk?
- Run most basic SMETANA example with 2 species
  - Could have them use metaGEM parser for this and previous step
  - Run smetana_vis.R script to visualize interactions in one medium
  - Change media composition with basic 2 species example
  - Run smetana_vis.R to visualize differences in interactions across 2 different media
- Choose your own adventure, explore either:
  - Interactions across 10 different media for 2 species
  - Interactions across 2 different media for 5 species
- Real world test case: metaGEM gut dataset
  - Go through dataset and analysis, showing how different mets/donors/receivers were identified across conditions
  - Simulate interactions between X species across all samples where species are present, identify statistically significant differences, visualize results
- Discussion on different analysis options/avenues
  - Other applications?
