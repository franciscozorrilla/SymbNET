## 💬 General Discussion

- What assumptions are made in genome-scale modelling approach
- What input data is required?
- What type of data can be integrated, how, and what for? E.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics
- How would you test the model predictions experimentally?
- Can the model predict unexpected interactions?
- Do you think this approach could be used in your project?
