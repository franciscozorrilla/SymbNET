## 🏁 Exercise 0: The data

 - Do you expect certain microbial communities to be cooperative or competitve? Why?
 - Rank the communities in the table above from most cooperative to most competitve and justify your answer.

## 🪚 Exercise 1: CarveMe model reconstruction

 - Are the number of metabolites, reactions, and genes in your community's models comparable to other metabolic reconstructions?
 - Is there variation in conspecific models reconstructed from different metagenomes?

## 💬 General Discussion

- What assumptions are made in genome-scale modelling approach
- What input data is required?
- What type of data can be integrated, how, and what for? E.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics
