## üï∏Ô∏è 3. Use SMETANA detailed algorithm to predict metabolic interactions between species

### Usage

```bash
$ smetana -h

usage: smetana [-h] [-c COMMUNITIES.TSV] [-o OUTPUT] [--flavor FLAVOR]
               [-m MEDIA] [--mediadb MEDIADB]
               [-g | -d | -a ABIOTIC | -b BIOTIC] [-p P] [-n N] [-v] [-z]
               [--solver SOLVER] [--molweight] [--exclude EXCLUDE]
               [--no-coupling]
               MODELS [MODELS ...]

Calculate SMETANA scores for one or multiple microbial communities.

positional arguments:
  MODELS                
                        Multiple single-species models (one or more files).
                        
                        You can use wild-cards, for example: models/*.xml, and optionally protect with quotes to avoid automatic bash
                        expansion (this will be faster for long lists): "models/*.xml". 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COMMUNITIES.TSV, --communities COMMUNITIES.TSV
                        
                        Run SMETANA for multiple (sub)communities.
                        The communities must be specified in a two-column tab-separated file with community and organism identifiers.
                        The organism identifiers should match the file names in the SBML files (without extension).
                        
                        Example:
                            community1	organism1
                            community1	organism2
                            community2	organism1
                            community2	organism3
                        
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Prefix for output file(s).
  --flavor FLAVOR       Expected SBML flavor of the input files (cobra or fbc2).
  -m MEDIA, --media MEDIA
                        Run SMETANA for given media (comma-separated).
  --mediadb MEDIADB     Media database file
  -g, --global          Run global analysis with MIP/MRO (faster).
  -d, --detailed        Run detailed SMETANA analysis (slower).
  -a ABIOTIC, --abiotic ABIOTIC
                        Test abiotic perturbations with given list of compounds.
  -b BIOTIC, --biotic BIOTIC
                        Test biotic perturbations with given list of species.
  -p P                  Number of components to perturb simultaneously (default: 1).
  -n N                  
                        Number of random perturbation experiments per community (default: 1).
                        Selecting n = 0 will test all single species/compound perturbations exactly once.
  -v, --verbose         Switch to verbose mode
  -z, --zeros           Include entries with zero score.
  --solver SOLVER       Change default solver (current options: 'gurobi', 'cplex').
  --molweight           Use molecular weight minimization (recomended).
  --exclude EXCLUDE     List of compounds to exclude from calculations (e.g.: inorganic compounds).
  --no-coupling         Don't compute species coupling scores.
```

### Detailed algorithm

1. The species coupling score (SCS) measures the dependence of growth of species A on species B (SCS<sub>A,B</sub>)
   - calculated by enumerating all possible community member subsets where species A can grow, SCS<sub>A,B</sub> is the fraction of subsets where both species A and B can grow.
2. The metabolite uptake score (MUS) measures the dependence of growth of species A on metabolite *m* (MUS<sub>A,*m*</sub>)
   - calculated by enumerating all possible metabolite requirement subsets where species A can grow, MUS<sub>A,*m*</sub> is the fraction of subsets where both species A grows and metabolite *m* is taken up.
3. The metabolite production score (MPS) is a binary score indicating whether a given species B can produce metabolite *m* (MPS = 1) or not (MPS = 0) in the community of N members (MPS<sub>B,*m*</sub>)
4. The SMETANA score ranges from 0 to 1
   - measures how strongly a receiver species relies on a donor species for a particular metabolite
   - SMETANA<sub>A,B,*m*</sub> = SCS<sub>A,B</sub> * MUS<sub>A,*m*</sub> * MPS<sub>B,*m*</sub>

### Pre-computed simulations
Unless you submit jobs in parallel on the cluster it will not be feasible to generate 100's of simulation results within the timeframe of this course. The following code demonstrates how the detailed interactions were precomputed for the different datasets. **You do not need to generate results for each community, as all results are pre-computed in their respective directories.**
 
Note: There may be equivalent solutions that satisfy the linear programming problems posed by the detailed and global algorithms. To explore the solution space run multiple simulations and then take averages. Use the `--molweight` flag to predict interactions on community-specific minimal media. Use the `--zeros` flag to take averages across samples.

The following shows how all detailed interactions were pre-computed, assuming your current folder contains your community's GEMs:
```bash
$ for i in {1..100}; do 
echo "Running simulation $i out of 100 ... "; 
smetana --flavor ucsd -o sim_${i} -v -d --molweight --zeros *.xml;
done
```
